The G2 demo needs a pixel dump (frame buffer binary) of the demo image to display it correctly.
The VDMA expects 1920x1080 pixels sequentially, left-to-right, up-to-down, 24 bits per pixel, 8 bits per color, ordered Red, Blue, Green.
Open the image in Gimp, choose Colors, Channel Mixer. Set the following mixer values:
Output	R	G	B
R	0	100	0
G	0	0	100
B	100	0	0
Go to File, Export Image. Choose Raw image data under Select File Type, give it a name and save it with the default settings.
